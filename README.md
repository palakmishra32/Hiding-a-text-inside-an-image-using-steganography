# Steganography
Project Title: Hiding a Text Inside an Image Using Steganography

This project demonstrates an implementation of RGB steganography, which hides a secret message within the pixel values of an image. Using an XOR operation with a provided security key, the ASCII values of the text are embedded into the RGB channels of the image. The project includes both encoding and decoding functionalities, allowing users to securely hide and retrieve sensitive information within images.
